Hey, code criminal! Uncover the dark secrets of your commit history, every crime(line of code) you've committed, every weapon (coding language) you've wielded, and every crime scene (repository) you've defiled. Review your total 'crimes,' track your felonious patterns, and maybe, just maybe, write a line of code that isn't a war crime next time!
